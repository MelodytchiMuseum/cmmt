			<h1>Colton Burdick</h1>
			<br>
			<h1>Competitor</h1>
			<p>I drew some design ideas (mainly in the way movies are displayed) from <a href = "http://www.regmovies.com">Regal Cinema's website</a>. As for the other pages, I did not draw much inspiration from anything.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Images and Videos</h1>
			<p>The logo was made by myself. The movie posters were obtained from <a href = "https://www.movieposter.com">movieposter.com</a> and <a href = "http://www.moviepostershop.com">moviepostershop.com</a>. The videos are not my own.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Form</h1>
			<p>The form I made can be found on the <a href="jobs.html">Jobs</a> page. The four controls the form contains are text boxes, radio buttons, check boxes, and a submit button.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>JavaScript Events</h1>
			<p>One JavaScript event can be found on the <a href="jobs.html">Jobs</a> page. It activates when the form is submitted, prompting a message to appear. Since the fields must be filled before anything can be submitted, the event will not trigger if the form is not filled out. The other JavaScript event can be found on the <a href="info.html">Location/Hours</a> page. It activates when the page is loaded, prompting a message to appear.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Tables</h1>
			<p>There are multiple tables that are formatted on the fly using CSS. The first table can be found on the <a href="index.html">Home</a> page; it contains the movies that are currently playing. Likewise, the second table can be found on the <a href="playing.html">Now Playing</a> page, also containing the movies that are currently playing. The <a href="jobs.html">Jobs</a> page also features a table, but it is not styled as much as the other tables are.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>HTML5 Design Elements</h1>
			<p>All of the pages, including this one, feature HTML5 design elements. All pages feature a "header" (with a "nav" section), an "article" that serves as the main body of the page, and a "footer" where the copyright information is displayed. The sections are stylized consistently using the external CSS file.</p>
